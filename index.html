    <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to be a reource bank for students interested in additional guidance during the college application process for highly selective institutions.</p>
    <h2>Why did I decide to create this website?</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of information disseminated online, in school and by word-of-mouth that can be very hard to sift through to find the honest truth. I want to shed light on the evaluation process from a unique perspective to help every student understand that the entire process is about showcasing who you are and not who you have artificially created yourself to be.</p>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>My name is Carina Arellano and I graduated from Duke University in 2017 with a Bachelor's Degree in Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies with two minors in Global Health and Philosophy. I worked for Duke University Undergraduate Admissions following graduation and specialized in Latinx student recruitment and yield. I am currently a law student at Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law and plan on entering the field of employment law. My goal for this website is to promote access to higher education and to be a resource for those who may need or want a helping hand during the college admission process.</p>
      <h2>How do I plan on accomplishing these goals?</h2>
        <p>I have created an 'Admissions' tab that delves more into terminology associated with college admissions. I also plan to offer support services for those interested in one-on-one mentorship. This mentorship will include:
          <ul>
            <li>Advice on your reach, target and likely schools.</li>
            <li>Advice on turning your interests into actions.</li>
            <li>Advice on how to best reflect on your unique experiences.</li>
            <li>Adive on how to practice and prepare for standardized testing.</li>
            <li>Honesty and transparency about the highly selective college admissions process.</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>What Does 'Holistic Admissions' <i><b>Really</b></i> Mean?</h2>
      <p class="bottomp">The term 'holistic admissions' means that there is no one part of your application that guarantees you <i><b>will</b></i> be admitted and there is no one part of your application that guarantees you <i><b>will not</b></i> be admitted. The admissions committee will look at every part of your application to inform their decision. They are not only looking for students who check boxes, but ones who will bring perspective and contribute to their campus in a meaningful way.</p>
      <h2>Why Do I Use 'A Hill' Analogy?</h2>
      <p class="bottomp">Everyone will start somewhere on a hill when it comes to college admissions. Some students will have a steeper journey than others depending on their experiences or personal situations. For anyone interested in highly selective admissions, the journey will be difficult as every institution has unique priorities when creating its next class.</p>
      <h2>How Do You Use This Knowledge Going Forward?</h2>
      <p class="bottomp">Try out things that you're actually interested in. If you curate your high school experience to fit into a certain college mold, it will not be as fruitfull of an experience.</p>
